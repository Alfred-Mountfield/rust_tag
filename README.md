# Rust-Tag

An Agent-based implementation of a game of tag or "It". 
Agents wander randomly around a 2D space. One of the agents is the 'tagger' and when they come within a 
nearby radius of another player they tag the other player thus making them the 'tagger'. 

## Requirements
* [Rust] (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Usage
* Simply run the following command from the repository root `cargo run`

## Disclaimer
This has only been tested on Windows, the visualisation library is supposedly cross-platform but such functionality is 
unsupported for this project.
